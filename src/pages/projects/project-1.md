In a full stack development course in college, I had made a fully functional eCommerce website using Ruby on Rails.
While you may say, "Tal, this website is really ugly!", I'd say your wrong and cry later so please don't say that. 


Without further ado, here's the title page for all you nice people :

While the first few books there are of the Malazan series, there are over a 1000 book titles randomly generated through the faker ruby gem.
A lot of the work here was primarily done through gem integrations, something that I greatly appreciate about ruby. It's very easy to
find a gem for whatever idea you may have. The gem does the brunt of the work, while you mainly have to figure out how to integrate you're work into them. They tend to offer enough flexability that really you can just use many as templates for whatever it is you want.
